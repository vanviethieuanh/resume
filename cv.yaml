    Summary:

        I spent days setting up my Arch Linux-powered workstation, not just for productivity but because I genuinely enjoy the process. On this system, I create elegant floral designs using the Desmos graphing tool, blending creativity with precision. As an experienced DevOps consultant, I bring the same passion for detail and optimization to my work, with a strong focus on cloud services and infrastructure automation. Proficient in Terraform, Azure Services, Azure DevOps, and Python, I also have deep expertise in OAuth and OIDC configurations.
